**Task Management System Mini Project**

Create a simple task management system where users can manage tasks, each with its own properties and functionalities. This project will help you explore classes, instance methods, inheritance, and more. Here are the main features:

1. **Task Class:** Create a `Task` class that represents a task with the following attributes:
   - `title` (the title or name of the task)
   - `description` (a brief description of the task)
   - `status` (the current status of the task, e.g., "incomplete" or "complete")

2. **Task List Class:** Implement a `TaskList` class that allows users to manage multiple tasks. This class should include methods for:
   - Adding tasks to the list.
   - Marking tasks as complete or incomplete.
   - Deleting tasks from the list.
   - Displaying a list of all tasks and their statuses.

3. **Priority Tasks:** Add an attribute to the `Task` class for task priority (e.g., low, medium, high). Allow users to filter tasks by priority.

4. **Due Dates:** Extend the `Task` class to include a due date attribute. Allow users to sort tasks by due date.

5. **Subtasks (Optional):** Implement a feature where tasks can have subtasks. Subtasks should also be instances of the `Task` class, and they can be added to a parent task. Implement methods to manage subtasks.

6. **User Interface (Optional):** If you want to take this project further, create a simple text-based user interface to interact with the task management system.
