2. **Prime Number Finder**:
   - Create a program that finds all prime numbers up to a given number.

3. **Logbook**:
   - Design a program that acts as a simple logbook or journal. Users can add short log entries (e.g., "Completed Chapter 5", "Attended Python Workshop") that are written into a log file. Display all log entries with timestamps. (Requires: built-in `open` function)

4. **Todo List Application**:

5. **Text Analyzer**:
   - Create a program that reads a text file and provides statistics like word count, sentence count, most common words, and average word length.

6. **Weather Checker**:
   - Create a program that fetches and displays the current weather for a given city. (Requires: `requests` library and an API like OpenWeatherMap)

7. **Basic Web Scraper**:
   - Design a program that scrapes and prints headlines from a news website. (Requires: `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` libraries)

8. **Password Generator**:
   - Create a program that generates strong passwords with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Allow users to specify the length.

9. **Password Validator**:
   - Design a tool that checks if a given password meets certain criteria: a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and a minimum length. The program should provide feedback on which criteria the password fails.

10. **Dictionary and Thesaurus Lookup**:
   - Create a program that allows users to enter a word and get its definition and synonyms. (Requires: PyDictionary library or an API like WordNet)
